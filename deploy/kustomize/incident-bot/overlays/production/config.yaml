Their decisions made as commander are final.\\n\\nYour job as an Incident Commander is to listen to the call and to watch the incident Slack room in order to provide clear coordination, recruiting others to gather context and details. You should not be performing any actions or remediations, checking graphs, or investigating logs. Those tasks should be delegated.\\n\\nAn IC should also be considering next steps and backup plans at every opportunity, in an effort to avoid getting stuck without any clear options to proceed and to keep things moving towards resolution.\\n\\nMore information: https://response.pagerduty.com/training/incident_commander/"
